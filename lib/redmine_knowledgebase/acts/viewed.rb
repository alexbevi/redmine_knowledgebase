    # == acts_as_viewed
    # Adds views count capabilities to any ActiveRecord object.
    # It has the ability to work with objects that have or don't special fields to keep a tally of the 
    # viewings for each object. 
    # In addition it will by default use the User model as the viewer object and keep the viewings per-user.
    # It can be configured to use another class.
    # The IP address are used to not repeat views from the same ip. Only one view are count by user or IP.
    #
    # Special methods are provided to create the viewings table and if needed, to add the special fields needed
    # to keep per-objects viewings fast for access to viewed objects. Can be easily used in migrations.
    #
    # == Example of usage:
    #
    #   class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
    #     acts_as_viewed
    #   end
    #
    #   In a controller:
    #
    #   bill = User.find_by_name 'bill'
    #   batman = Video.find_by_title 'Batman'
    #   toystory  = Video.find_by_title 'Toy Story'
    #
    #   batman.view request.remote_addr, bill
    #   toystory.view  request.remote_addr, bill
    #
    #   batman.view_count     # => 1
